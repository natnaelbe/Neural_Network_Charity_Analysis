# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview
### We are using features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
## Data preprocessing
### The columns that are not categorized as the "IS_SUCCESSFUL" category are the target variables.
### The "IS_SUCCESSFUL" column would be known as the feature variables.
### No variables should be removed from the input data.
## Compiling, training, and evaluating
### The number of input features do not appear to be identified. There are 3 layers and 3 activation functions.
### I believe I was able to achieve the intended performance because initially I was getting a memory error and my values were out of range. Once I edited my code, I received smaller values and my table size was greatly reduced.
### I changed the numerical values as well as changing my hidden node layers to 80 for the first layer and 30 for the second layer.
